Week of 2/15:
I've been working through Thm Proving in Lean, although we're still stuck in the "defining things properly" phase.

I'm sort of stuck on how to define a graph so that it works best in the long run. 
We currently have graph defined via a binary relation, but I'm not sure if that will be the best definition of a graph to use in the long run.
I've created a new file where I'm trying to redefine everything using sets. The main advantage that this will have is that when we're building a retract we can easily define the output graph (just the vertex set minus the corner).

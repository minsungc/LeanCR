# LeanCR

LeanCR is a project formalizing the game of Cops and Robber in the Lean theorem prover. The implementation is focused on generality to accomodate for the wide range of different variations of the game there exists in current mathematical literature. 

## Current Goals

The main goal of this project is twofold: 

1. Formalize the setup of the Cops and Robber game in Lean
2. Prove the landmark theorem by Aigner and Fromme (and independently by Quillot): a finite graph is cop-win if and only if it is dismantlable.
